<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>We have developed a system of using small acrylic blocks with NFC tags placed on the bottom, alongside a framework which allows for code to be inserted into a word processing program and then processed as code.</p>
<p>So far, we have enough tags to be able to calculate problems, then print them to the console.</p>
<p>We were unable to properly test our design with the intended audience, on account of delays and time constraints. Additionally, doing so would be incredibly tedious, as actually finding a child within the proper age range would take copious amounts of time.</p>
