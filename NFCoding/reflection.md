<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>With this research project, we have surely learned a valuable lesson about, if nothing else, the sheer importance of proper communication. </p>
<p>The vast majority of the issues we listed previously resulted from little to no actual interaction between our group and the teachers, or a lack of cooperation within the group itself. </p>
<p>Our materials arrived much later than we hoped due to a misunderstanding between the group and teachers. </p>
<p>Our group seldom spoke outside of allocated working time, and we never planned anything outside of those periods. </p>
<p>If we could completely redo this project, we would ensure that our voice was properly heard in the first place, and assigned each member their own task, rather than dividing work whenever it came. </p>
<p>If possible, we would also have attempted to acquire more tags, allowing greater freedom in what we could create. </p>
<p>Our process for deciding what would specifically be part of the program lasted until the last few days, so greater planning and organization is certainly something we would attempt to perform if we had such a project again. </p>
<p>Additionally, we would have begun with a less ambitious goal, as setting such high expectations only leads to sadness and failure.</p>
